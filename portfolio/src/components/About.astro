    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Nico, I'm 22 years old and I'm from Uruguay. I've always been
        drawn to the visual side of things I started with drawing, then
        discovered design, and eventually found web development as the perfect
        way to blend creativity with logic. I enjoy creating visual experiences
        for others to engage with, focusing on clean, modern, and polished
        interfaces. I'm currently specializing in Full-Stack web development.
